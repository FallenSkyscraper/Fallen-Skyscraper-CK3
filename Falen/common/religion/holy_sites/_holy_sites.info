Faiths can have holy sites, giving various effects (mostly through references elsewhere in script).

== Structure ==
holy_site_name = {
	county = c_somewhere
	
	flag = flag1
	flag = flag2
	
	character_modifier = { # Optional. Applied to all characters of any faith with this holy site when the holder of the barony is of their faith
		some effects
	}
}

== Localisation ==
The name of the holy site will be "holy_site_<key>_name".
The custom effect description will be "holy_site_<key>_ effects". It'll be used in addition to the character modifier (if any).
