In this folder, categories of court amenities and the settings they can take can be defined

== Structure ==
All script has the owner of the court as ROOT.

court_amenities_category_name = {
	default = court_amenities_setting_name 	# Optional. New rulers will by default start with court amenities at this setting for this category
	
	# The order individual settings are defined in here determines the order they are displayed in in the UI. I.e. settings defined first are displayed to the left, and those defined last are displayed to the right.
	court_amenities_setting_name = {
		owner_modifier = { 					# Modifier applied to the owner of the court when amenities are at this setting
		}

		ai_will_do = { ... }				# Script value in ruler scope. Court amenities are decided in the RARE_TASK_TICK. If multiple amenity levels are possible, the AI will enact the one with the highest score, with a bias towards the currently active one of CURRENT_COURT_AMENITY_SETTING_ADDED_WEIGHT to prevent switching back and forth to closely scored options
		# The AI tries to get the single-level increase that gives the biggest increase in score
		# This means that you want the scores to gradually become smaller, or the AI will go far down one path ignoring all the rest

		can_pick = { ... }					# Trigger to check if the scoped character can pick this setting. Make sure that there are no gaps in tiers here. 
											# Note that these triggers MUST be repeated to higher tiers because the AI does not skip levels when adjusting
											# court amenities, it goes level by level both up and down.
