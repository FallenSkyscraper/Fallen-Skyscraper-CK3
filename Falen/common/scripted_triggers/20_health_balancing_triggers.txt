### HEALTH BALANCING TRIGGERS ###
# Along with the health balancing effects, these triggers are only used to get data output used for balancing diseases.


# For activating data output on the number of victims (total, dead and surviving) for contagious disease outbreaks. Combine with a run file like this to quickly collect data:

#every_independent_ruler = {
#	random_courtier = {
#		trigger_event = health.1011 #1011 is plague, 1010 is smallpox
#	}
#}


debug_activate_contagious_disease_outbreak_data_trigger = {
	always = no
}
