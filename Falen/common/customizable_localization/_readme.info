The following scope types can be defined as the "type" in a "type = X" argument.
It should match whatever scope you use the custom loc command in.

artifact
character
landed_title
province
activity
secret
scheme
combat
combat_side
title_and_vassal_change
faith
dynasty

empty <- Not supported right now. Might be added as a "wildcard" in the future, accepting all scope types

== format ==
key = {
	type = scope


	text = {
		trigger = { ... }
		localization_key = string
		fallback = yes # Optional; will cause this one to be picked if no 
	}

	...

	random_valid = yes # Optional, will randomize instead of picking first valid
}

You can also add variants:
key = {
	parent = some_custom_loc_key
	suffix = "_suffix"
}
The logic of the parent will be run, then the suffix is added to the custom loc key.
